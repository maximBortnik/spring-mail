Guide to Spring Email

The interfaces and classes for Java mail support in the Spring framework are organized as follows:
1. MailSender interface:
   The top-level interface that provides basic functionality for sending simple emails
2. JavaMailSender interface:
   The subinterface of the above MailSender. It supports MIME messages and is mostly used in conjunction with
   the MimeMessageHelper class for the creation of a MimeMessage. Itâ€™s recommended to use the MimeMessagePreparator
   mechanism with this interface
3. JavaMailSenderImpl class:
   Provides an implementation of the JavaMailSender interface.
   It supports the MimeMessage and SimpleMailMessage
4. SimpleMailMessage class:
   Used to create a simple mail message including the from, to, cc, subject and text fields
5. MimeMessagePreparator interface:
   provides a callback interface for the preparation of MIME messages
6. MimeMessageHelper class:
   helper class for the creation of MIME messages. It offers support for images, typical mail attachments
   and text content in an HTML layout

7. MailMessage interface:
   This is a common interface for mail messages, allowing a user to set key values required in assembling a mail message,
   without needing to know if the underlying message is a simple text message or a more sophisticated MIME message.
